# I MADE A LITTLE CHANGE: HYUNGMOOK STEVE OH HYUSTEOH HOPEFULLY NOTHING BREAKS
# Use https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/bachelor-science-
# information/bsi-admissions as a template.
# STEPS 
# Create a similar HTML file but 
# 1) Replace every occurrence of the word “student” with “AMAZING
# student.”  
# 2) Replace the main picture with a picture of yourself.
# 3) Replace any local images with the image I provided in media.  (You
# must keep the image in a separate folder than your html code.

# Deliverables
# Make sure the new page is uploaded to your GitHub account.

#Just making a change to report on how I'm doing. 11/6/16. Pretty grim, don't know where I should or how I could start the project. However, starting to understand nltk better, just need to go to office hours for more information.
